# By for example publishing updates with a 'current_version'
# that's one month ahead, you can suppress minor updates

# List of regular expressions, comma-separated, which will be
# removed from the ZIP file entry.
# If result is empty string, the entry is skipped.
#
# The update ZIP file can have various formats.
#
# Basic ZIP file:
#    phoebus-{site, version}/*
#
# => Remove 'phoebus-.*' from entry name
#    to install _content_ of zip into install_location
#    without creating yet another subdir
#
# ZIP that's packaged for Windows, including JDK:
#    product-sns-0.0.1/*
#    jdk/*
#
# => Remove 'product-sns-*' from entry name,
#    skip 'jdk'.
#
# ZIP that's packaged for Mac: Either
#    phoebus.app/product-sns-0.0.1/*  => Remove .../
#    phoebus.app/jdk/*                => Skip
#    phoebus.app/Contents/*           => Skip
# or:
#    CSS_Phoebus.app/product-sns-0.0.1/*  => Remove .../
#    CSS_Phoebus.app/jdk/*                => Skip
#    CSS_Phoebus.app/Contents/*           => Skip
#
# Example:
# phoebus\.app/  - Strip Mac "phoebus.app/" from entries
#                  so they look more like the Windows example
#
# phoebus-[^/]+/ - Strip phoebus product name from ZIP entry
#
# jdk/.*         - Remove complete jdk entry to skip it
