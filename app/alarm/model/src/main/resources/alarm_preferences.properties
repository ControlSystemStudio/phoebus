# The initial flurry of alarm tree updates can be slow
# to render. By allowing the alarm client to accumulate
# alarm tree information for a little time and then
# performing an initial bulk representation, the overall
# alarm tree startup can be faster, especially when
# the UI is viewed via a remote desktop

# By default, the alarm table uses the common alarm severity colors
# for both the text color and the background of cells in the "Severity" column.

# for the background, automatically using black or white for the text
# based on brightness.
