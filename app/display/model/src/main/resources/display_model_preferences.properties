# Global macros, used for all displays.
#
# Displays start with these macros,
# and can then add new macros or overwrite
# the values of these macros.
#
# Format:
# Entries where the XML tag name is the macro name,
# and the XML content is the macro value.
# The macro name must be a valid XML tag name:
# * Must start with character
# * May then contain characters or numbers
# * May also contain underscores

# 'BOY' *.opi files provide the font size in 'points'.
# All other positions and sizes are in 'pixels'.
# A point is meant to represent 1/72th of an inch.
# The actual on-screen size display settings.
# Plugging a different monitor into the computer can
# potentially change the DPI settings of the graphics driver,
# resulting in different font sizes.
# The display builder uses fonts in pixels to avoid such changes.
#
# When reading legacy display files, we do not know the DPI
# scaling that was used to create the display.
# This factor is used to translate legacy font sizes
# from 'points' into 'pixel':
#
# legacy_points = pixel * legacy_font_calibration
#
# The test program 
#   org.csstudio.display.builder.representation.swt.SWTFontCalibation
# can be used to obtain the factor when executed on the original
# platform where the legacy display files were created.
#
# When loading legacy files,
# _increasing_ the legacy_font_calibration will
# result in _smaller_ fonts in the display builder
legacy_font_calibration=1.01

# Maximum re-parse operations
#
# When reading legacy *.opi files and for example
# finding a "TextUpdate" widget that has no <pv_name>,
# it will be changed into a "Label" widget and then re-parsed.
# If more than a certain number of re-parse operations are triggered
# within one 'level' of the file (number of widgets at the root of the display,
# or number of childred for a "Group" widget),
# the parser assumes that it entered an infinite re-parse loop
# and aborts.
max_reparse_iterations=5000

# When writing a display file, skip properties that are still at default values?
skip_defaults=true
