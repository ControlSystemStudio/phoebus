     * Create an iterator reading samples from a JSON parser. The parser is
     * <em>not</em> closed when this iterator is closed. However, the

     * the calling code can pass a function that closes the parser.
     *
     * @param parser
     *  JSON parser from which samples are read. The iterator expects that the
     *  parserâ€™s current token is the start of an array and reads samples until
     *  the current token is the corresponding end of an array.
     * @param on_close
     *  function that is called when the iterator is closed. May be
     *  <code>null</code>.
     * @param request_url
     *  URL that was used to retrieve the JSON data. This is only used when
     *  logging error messages.
     * @param honor_zero_precision
     *  whether a precision of zero should result in no fractional digits being
     *  used in the number format of returned values (<code>true</code>) or a
     *  default number  format should be used when the precision is zero
     *  (<code>false</code>). This only applies to floating-point values.
     *  Integer values always use  a number format that does not include
     *  fractional digits.
     * @throws IOException
     *  if initial operations on the JSON parser fail or if the JSON document
     *  is malformed. Errors that occur later do not result in an exception
     *  being thrown. Instead, the error is logged and {@link #hasNext()}
     *  returns <code>false</code>.
