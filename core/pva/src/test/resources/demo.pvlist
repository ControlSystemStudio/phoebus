# 'pvlist' example
#
# Syntax is similar to the CA or p4p Gateway:
#
#    {regular expression for PV name}     DENY
#    {regular expression for PV name}     DENY FROM  {IP}
#    {regular expression for PV name}     ALLOW
#    {regular expression for PV name}     ALLOW  {ASG}
#
# https://epics-base.github.io/p4p/gw.html#pvlist-file
#
# If no ASG listed for ALLOW, it defaults to 'DEFAULT'
#
# Compared to the CA gateway, the mode is always
# EVALUATION ORDER ALLOW, DENY
#
# This means that DENY has preference over ALLOW.
# DENY statements are checked first and matching PVs are blocked,
# even if an ALLOW statement would follow.

# Ignore searches for PVs named 'Ignore:...' 
Ignore:.*   DENY

# Ignore searches for PVs from a certain beam line
# BL10:.*   DENY

# Ignore searches for any PVs from specific host,
# useful to prevent search loops
.*          DENY FROM 11.12.13.14

# .*          DENY FROM 10.1.58.243
# .*          DENY FROM 10.159.201.93

.*          DENY FROM www.google.com

# Then list ALLOW statements, where matching PVs are accepted
# and considered to be in the access group ASG(DEFAULT)
SomePV     ALLOW
Vac:.*     ALLOW

# PV where access is allowed to those in the ASG(RF)
SomeRFSetting ALLOW RF

# If a PV does not match any ALLOW rule, it is DENYed,
# so add this if there are no specific ALLOW pattern
.*          ALLOW
