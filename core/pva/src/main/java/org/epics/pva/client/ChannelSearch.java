/** Handler for search requests
 *
 *  <p>Maintains thread that periodically issues search requests
 *  for registered channels.
 *  Search periods match the design of https://github.com/mdavidsaver/pvxs,
 *  repeating searches for missing channels after 1, 2, 3, ..., 30 seconds
 *  and then continuing every 30 seconds.
 *  The exact period is not a multiple of 1000ms but 1000+-25ms to randomly
 *  distribute searches from different clients.
 *  Once the search plateaus at 30 seconds, which takes about 7.6 to 7.9 minutes,
 *  the search can be "boosted" back to 1, 2, 3, ... seconds.
 *  Since long running servers issue beacons every ~3 minutes,
 *  every existing PVA server on the network will appear "new" when a client
 *  receives its first beacon within ~3 minutes after startup.
 *  Such beacons are ignored for the ~7 minutes where the search period settles
 *  to avoid unnecessary network traffic.
 *
 *  <p>Can send search requests to unicast (IPv4 and IPv6), multicast (4 & 6), broadcast (IPv4 only).
 *  Since only StandardProtocolFamily.INET sockets support IPv4 multicast,
 *  but then won't handle IPv6 traffic, need to maintain one socket per protocol family.
 *
 *  <p>Can also search via TCP. While TCP is fundamentally reliable, we don't expect lost
 *  search requests as with UDP, search requests are still repeated because the PVA gateway
 *  is stateless with respect to searches.
 *  The gateway does not remember past searches.
 *  When the gateway receives the first search request for an unknown channel,
 *  the gateway itself will start to search for that channel on its client side.
 *  Once it connects to the channel, the gateway then depends on another search request for the now
 *  known channel to return a positive reply.
 *  TCP searches thus need to be repeated, but compared to the UDP searches they are sent less frequently.
