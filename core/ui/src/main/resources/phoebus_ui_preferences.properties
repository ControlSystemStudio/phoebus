# 'Welcome' URL
#
# When left empty, the built-in welcome.html resource is used.
# Site-specific products can set this to their desired URL,
# which may include Java system properties to bundle content
# with the product, for example
#  file:$(phoebus.install)/welcome_to_hawkins_labs.html

# Default applications
#
# When there are multiple applications that handle
# a resource, the setting determines the one used by default.
#
# Format is comma-separated list with sub-text of default application names.
# For example, "run, exe" would pick "display_runtime" over "display_editor",
# and "foo_executor" over "foo_creator".
# The patterns "edit, creat" would inversely open the editor-type apps.
#
# This makes the display_runtime and the 3d_viewer default apps,
# using display_editor and a potentially configured text editor for *.shp files secondary

# Toolbar entries
#
# Apps like the file browser contribute a toolbar entry.
# This setting can control which toolbar entries are shown
# and for the most part also in which order.
#
# Format: Comma-separated list of entries.
#
# The special entry "*" adds all remaining available toolbar entries.
# An entry starting with "!" removes that item from the available entries.
# The order of the initial buttons "Home, Top Resources, Layouts, Add Layouts"
# cannot be changed, but they can be suppressed by adding "!",
# for example "Home, !Top Resources, !Layouts, !Add Layouts".
#
# The special entry "Add Layouts" is NOT added to the toolbar by default. It
# can be added to the toolbar by specifying "Add Layouts".
#
# The strings in the list of entries MUST match what is returned from
# ToolbarEntry#getId(). This allows for customization/localization of app name
# without the need to adjust the list.
#
# Examples:
#
# Default buttons, then all remaining available items:
#
#    Home, Top Resources, Layouts, *
#
# Default buttons, then assert that File Browser comes next:
#
#    Home, Top Resources, Layouts, File Browser, *
#
# Only Home and File Browser:
#
#    Home, !Top Resources, !Layouts, File Browser
toolbar_entries=Home, Top Resources, Layouts, File Browser, *

# When Picture- and/or Symbol widgets are present in an OPI,
# zooming in under Windows using the D3D graphics library can
# cause excessive VRAM usage. Setting a cache hint can work as
# a workaround. Since it has been observed that the cache hints
# also can cause graphical errors, the setting of a cache hint
# is a configurable option, which must explicitly be set to
# have effect.
#
# The setting defaults to the default caching behavior.
#
# Valid options are:
#       "" (the empty string) or "NONE" - The default caching behavior: caching is DISABLED, and the cache hint is set to "CacheHint.DEFAULT".
#       "DEFAULT"                       - Caching is ENABLED, and the cache hint is set to "CacheHint.DEFAULT".
#       "SPEED"                         - Based on very limited testing, this option seems to work the best as a workaround for the excessive VRAM usage.
#       "QUALITY"
#       "SCALE"                         - This option has been observed to cause graphical errors on several systems: rotated widgets have been observed to be translated instead of rotated.
#       "ROTATE"
#       "SCALE_AND_ROTATE"
#
# If an invalid option is entered, a warning is logged, and the
# default caching behavior is used (i.e., caching is DISABLED,
# and the cache hint is set to "CacheHint.DEFAULT").
