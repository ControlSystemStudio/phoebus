# Authorization file
#
# If left empty, the built-in `core/security/authorization.conf` is used.
#
# When specifying a plain file name like `authorization.conf`,
# the install location (`Locations.install()`) is searched for that file name.
#
# The file name can also be an absolute path like `/some/path/auth.conf`.
#
# Finally, the file name may use a system property like `$(auth_file)`
# which in turn could be set to either BUILTIN, a file in the install location,
# or an absolute path.
#
# When set to an invalid file, the user will have no authorizations at all.
authorization_file=

# Secure store underlying implementation.
#
# :format: one of `FILE` or `IN_MEMORY`
