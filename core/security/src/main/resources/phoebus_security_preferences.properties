# Authorization file
#
# If left empty, the built-in core/security/authorization.conf is used.
#
# When specifying a plain file name like "authorization.conf",
# the install location (Locations.install()) is searched for that file name.
#
# The file name can also be an absolute path like /some/path/auth.conf.
#
# Finally, the file name may use a system property like $(auth_file)
# which in turn could be set to either BUILTIN, a file in the install location,
# or an absolute path.
#
# When set to an invalid file, the user will have no authorizations at all.

# Use built-in core/security/authorization.conf
authorization_file=

# Use authorization.conf in the install location
#authorization_file=authorization.conf
