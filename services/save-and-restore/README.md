# Save and restore service

The save-and-restore service implements service as a collection
of REST endpoints. These can be used by clients to manage configurations (aka save sets) and
snapshots, to compare snapshots and to restore PV values from snapshots.

The service is packaged as a self-contained Spring Boot jar file. External dependencies are limited to a JVM (Java 17+)
and a running instance of Elasticsearch (8.x).

# Build

Build the Phoebus product. The jar file generated by default in the target directory of the save and restore service module
is a self-contained Spring Boot executable. It includes Tomcat dependencies and should
hence not be deployed to an external web application server.

To convert the build artifact to a war file for
deployment to an application server, see https://spring.io/guides/gs/convert-jar-to-war/

# Run

Run the service like so:

`java [options] -jar service-save-and-restore-<version>.jar`

Where [options] may override default values for Elasticsearch host (localhost) and port (9200):

-Delasticsearch.network.host=[host]  
-Delasticsearch.http.port=[port]

or you can use a `.properties file`

`java -Dspring.config.location=/path/to/save_restore.properties -jar service-save-and-restore-<version>.jar`

# Verification

To check that the server is running correctly.

```
$ curl --fail-with-body http://localhost:8080/save-restore
{
  "name" : "service-save-and-restore",
  "version" : "4.7.4-SNAPSHOT",
  "elastic" : {
    "status" : "Connected",
    "clusterName" : "elastic-nasa",
    "clusterUuid" : "QNeYpFlWRueYPH3uXGUiGw",
    "version" : "co.elastic.clients.elasticsearch._types.ElasticsearchVersionInfo@3d95cef6"
  },
  "rootNodeID" : "44bef5de-e8e6-4014-af37-b8f6c8a939a2"
}
```

The response will have information about the service version, the root node id, the status of the connection with the elastic backend.

# Documentation

Details about the REST API is found in the Phoebus bundled help content, which is pulled from the doc/index.rst file.

# Docker

The latest version of the service is available as a Docker image (ghcr.io/controlsystemstudio/phoebus/service-save-and-restore:master). Any pushes to the master branch into this directory will trigger a new build of the image.

To run the service and its dependency (Elasticsearch), use docker-compose.yml.
