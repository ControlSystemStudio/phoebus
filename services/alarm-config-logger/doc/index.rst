Alarm Configuration Logging
===========================

A simple service which logs all the configuration changes made to the alarm server configuration.

The alarm configuration tree is mapped to a directory structure where each node is represented by a directory and each leaf is a json file describing the alarm configuration for that element.

The above file structure also uses the git version control system which allows us to trace all changes made to the alarm configuration.
