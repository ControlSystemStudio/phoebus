Alarm Logging Service
=====================

The alarm logging service records all alarm messages to create an archive of all 
alarm state changes and the associated actions.

This historical data can be used to:  

1. Discover alarm patterns and trends
2. Generate Statistical reports on alarms
3. Debug the alarm system

Logged Alarm Messages
*********************

The alarm logging service creates kafka streams which can be configured to monitor one or more alarm topics. All associated with state change or configuration change are filtered, time stamped and added to an elastic index.

Examples:

* **Configuration changes** 

 e.g. when new alarm nodes or pvs are added or removed or existing ones are enabled/disabled 

* **State changes** 

 e.g. alarm state changes from OK to MAJOR

* **Commands** 

 e.g. a user actions to *Acknowledge* an alarm

Automatic purge of Elasticsearch indices
****************************************

To avoid issues related to a high number of Elasticsearch indices, automatic purge can be enabled in order to delete
indices considered obsolete. This is done by setting the preference ``retention_period_days`` to a number larger
or equal to 100. The default value is 0, i.e. automatic purge is disabled by default.

The automatic purge is run using a cron expression defined in preference ``purge_cron_expr``, default is
``0 0 0 * * SUN``, i.e. midnight each Sunday. See the SpringDocumentation_ on how to define the cron expression.

An Elasticsearch index is considered eligible for deletion if the last inserted message date is before current time
minus ``retention_period_days``.
