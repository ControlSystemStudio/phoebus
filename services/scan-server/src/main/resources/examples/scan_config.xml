  <!-- Value check timeout [seconds]
       Set and Loop commands have a timeout that is used
       to wait for completion or
       to wait for the readback to match.
       When using completion _and_ checking a readback,
       the readback check does not use the full timeout but instead
       checks if the value matches "right away" after completion has been confirmed.
       This check, however, needs to read the current value of the PV,
       so it also needs some timeout.
       Similarly, the Log command uses this timeout to fetch the current
       value of the devices to log
       and the simulation uses this to await the connection of all PVs.
