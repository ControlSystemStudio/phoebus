# PV Factory
# Default is 'vtype.pv', but additional PV support may be available
# via extension point
pv_factory=vtype.pv

# PV Name Patches
#
# Translate PV names based on regular expression pattern and replacement
#
# Format:  pattern@replacement@pattern@replacement
#
# Setting must contain a sequence of pattern & replacement pairs,
# all separated by '@'.
#
# The regular expression for the pattern can includes "( )" groups,
# which are then used in the replacement via "$1", "$2", ..
#
# If the item separator character '@' itself is required within the pattern or replacement,
# use '[@]' to distinguish it from the item separator, i.e.
#  
#    [@]work@[@]home
#
# will patch "be@work" -> "be@home"
#
# Patches are applied in the order they're listed in the preference, i.e.
# later patches are applied to names already patched by earlier ones.
#
# Example:
# Remove PVManager's longString modifier,             'some_pv {"longString":true}' -> 'some_pv'
# turn constant formula into constant local variable, '=42'                         -> 'loc://const42(42)'
# as well as constant name into constant local var,   '="Fred"'                     -> 'loc://strFred("Fred")'
