Phoebus Product
===============

The phoebus repo consists of a simple common product consisting of most of the commonly used applications.

The extensible and modular nature of the Phoebus framework allows for developers to assemble their own products. These
products can be include or exclude applications and configurations to address the needs of a particular organization or
workflow.
