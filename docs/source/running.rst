Starting CS-Studio/Phoebus
==========================

For build instructions, refer to the README.md on https://github.com/ControlSystemStudio/phoebus

For pre-built binaries, see https://controlssoftware.sns.ornl.gov/css_phoebus/

From the command-line, invoke ``phoebus.sh -help``, which will look
similar to this, but check your copy of CS-Studio/Phoebus
for the complete list::

Command Line Parameters for Applications
----------------------------------------

To open an application feature like "probe" or the "pv_tree" from the command line,
use the following example parameters.

Open empty instance of probe::

    phoebus.sh -app probe

Open empty PV Table::

    phoebus.sh -app pv_table

Open a file with the appropriate application feature (PV Table in this case)::

    phoebus.sh -resource "/path/to/example.pvs"

The '-resource' parameter can be a URI for a file or web link::

    phoebus.sh -resource "http://my.site/path/to/example.pvs"

Some resource types are supported by multiple applications.
For example, a display file "my_display.bob" can be handled by both
the "display_runtime" and the "display_editor" application.
A preference setting "org.phoebus.ui/default_apps" defines
which application will be used by default,
and a specific application can be requested like this::

    phoebus.sh -resource "/path/to/my_display.bob?app=display_editor"

The schema 'pv://?PV1&PV2&PV3' is used to pass PV names,
and the 'app=..' query parameter picks a specific app for opening the resource.

Since such resource URLs can contain characters like `&` that would also
be interpreted by the Linux shell, best enclose all resources in quotes.

Open probe with a PV name::

    phoebus.sh -resource "pv://?sim://sine&app=probe"              


Open PV Table with some PVs::

    phoebus.sh -resource "pv://?MyPV&AnotherPV&YetAnotherPV&app=pv_table"              

Note that all these examples use the internal name of the application feature,
for example "pv_table", and not the name that is displayed the user interface,
like "PV Table".
Use the ``-list`` option to see the names of all available application features.

Start with a specific layout::

    phoebus.sh -layout /path/to/mylayout.memento

Restores the layout saved in a (non-default) memento file. User may create such a file from menu option
*Window -> Save Layout As...*

Start with clean workspace::

    phoebus.sh -clean

This will suppress restore of the layout saved in the default memento file in order to start the application with an
empty workspace. If specified, ``-resource``, ``-app`` and ``-layout`` will be ignored.

Server Mode
-----------

By default, each invocation of ``phoebus.sh ...`` will start a new instance,
with its own main window etc.

In a control room environment it is often advantageous to run only one instance
on a given computer.
For this scenario, invoke ``phoebus.sh`` with the ``-server`` option, using
a TCP port that you reserve for this use on that computer, for example::

   phoebus.sh -server 4918
   
The first time you start phoebus this way, it will actually open the main window.
Follow-up invocations, for example::

   phoebus.sh -server 4918 -resource "/path/to/some/file.pvs"

will contact the already running instance and have it open the requested file.
