   # We've seen Oracle lockups, though, that caused JDBC to hang forever
   # because the SAMPLE table was locked. No error/exception, just hanging.

   # Setting the timeout to 0 disables calls to setQueryTimeout.
   timeout_secs=0
   
   # Use a blob to read/write array samples?
   #
   # The original SAMPLE table did not contain an ARRAY_VAL column
   # for the array blob data, but instead used a separate ARRAY_VAL table.
   # When running against an old database, this parameter must be set to false.

   # Channel names use a prefix ca://, pva://, loc://, ...
   # to select the type of PV or network protocol.
   # The preference setting
   #
   #  org.phoebus.pv/default=ca
   #
   # determines the default type when no prefix is provided.
   #
   # With EPICS IOCs from release 7 on, the PVs
   # "xxx", "ca://xxx" and "pva://xxx" all refer
   # to the same record "xxx" on the IOC.
   #
   # The archive configuration stores the PV name as given.
   # It is used as such when connecting to the live data source,
   # resulting in "ca://.." or "pva://.." connections as requested.
   # Samples are written to the archive under that channel name.
   #
   # This archive engine preference setting establishes one or more prefixes
   # as equal when importing an engine configuration.
   # For example, assume
   #
   #  equivalent_pv_prefixes=ca, pva
   #
   # When adding a PV "pva://xxx" to the configuration,
   # we check if the archive already contains a channel "xxx", "ca://xxx" or "pva://xxx".
   # If any of them are found, the `-import` will consider "pva://xxx" as a duplicate.
   #
   # When importing a PV "pva://xxx" into a sample engine configuration that already
   # contains the channel "ca://xxx" or "xxx", the channel will be renamed,
   # so that engine will from now on use "pva://xxx".
   #
   # When importing a PV "pva://xxx" into a configuration that already
   # contains a different engine setup with the channel "ca://xxx" or "xxx",
   # the channel will by default rename unchanged, so "ca://xxx" or "xxx"
   # will remain in their original engine setup, "pva://xxx" will be skipped.
   #
   # When using `-import` with the additional `-steal_channels` option,
   # the existing "...xxx" channel will be renamed to "pva://xxx" and moved
   # to the imported engine configuration.
   #
   # When `equivalent_pv_prefixes` is empty,
   # any PV name is used as is without looking for equivalent names.
   # So "xxx", "ca://xxx" and "pva://xxx" can then all be imported
   # as separate channels, which is likely wrong because it would simply
   # store data from the same underlying record more than once.
   #
   # This default should be the most practical setting when adding
   # EPICS 7 IOCs and starting to transition towards "pva://..".
   # Existing "xxx" or "ca://xxx" channels can thus be renamed
   # to "pva://xxx" while retaining their sample history.
   #
   # Note that the data browser has a similar `equivalent_pv_prefixes`
   # setting to search for a channel name in several variants.
   equivalent_pv_prefixes=ca, pva
