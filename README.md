Phoebus is a framework and a collections of tools to monitor and operate large scale control systems, such as the ones in the accelerator community. Phoebus is an update of the Control System Studio toolset that removes dependencies on Eclipse RCP and SWT.

More information:

## Requirements
 - [At least JDK9](http://jdk.java.net/9/)
 - [maven 2.x](https://maven.apache.org/) or [ant](http://ant.apache.org/)


## Target Platform

All external dependencies are expected in `dependencies/target/lib`.
They could be obtained by expanding a zip-ed folder from an existing build setup, or via one initial maven run:


```
mvn clean verify  -f dependencies/pom.xml
```


## Building with maven

 
### Building

```
mvn clean install
```

### Running test application
```
cd phoebus-product/target
java -jar product-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```



## Building with ant

```
ant clean run
```


## Developing with Eclipse

Download Eclipse Oxygen 4.7.1a from http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/

Start Eclipse like this:

	export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk-9
	export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
	eclipse/eclipse -consoleLog

Check Eclipse Preferences:

 * Java, Installed JREs: JDK 9 should be the default
 * Java, Compiler: JDK Compliance should be at least "9"


### Use plain Java configuration

Use `File`, `Import`, `General`, `Existing Projects into Workspace`.
Select the phoebus root directory, and check the option to "Seach for nested projects".

By default, all projects should be selected ('dependencies', 'core-framework', .., 'product').

Invoke `Run As/Java Application` on the `Launcher` in the product.


### Use Maven Files in Eclipse

In Help/Eclipse Marketplace, search for Maven Integration for Eclipse Luna or newer

Use File/Import/Maven/Existing Maven Projects to import the phoebus source code.

There can be a compiler error because the "JRE System Library" in the Package Explorer shows "[J2SE-1.4]".
Right click on the affected projects (greeting-app, probe), Build Path, Configure Build Path, Libraries, Edit the JRE System Library to use the Workspace default (jdk-9).
Restart Eclipse IDE.

Can now start product/src/main/java/org.phoebus.product/Launcher.java.

For full functionality add the java.corba modules to the launch configuration.

    git clone https://github.com/kasemir/phoebus-doc.git
    git clone https://github.com/shroffk/phoebus.git

    cd phoebus-doc
    # Building the manual will locate and include
    # all ../phoebus/applications/**/doc/index.rst
    make html
    # Windows: Use make.bat html

    cd ../phoebus
    # Fetch dependencies
    mvn clean verify -f dependencies/pom.xml

    # Building the product will bundle
    # ../phoebus-doc/build/html
    # as phoebus-product/target/doc
    ant
    # or mvn clean install
    
    # Could now run the product via phoebus-product/phoebus.sh,
    # or ZIP for distribution
    ant dist
