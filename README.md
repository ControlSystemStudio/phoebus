## Requirements
 - [JDK9 or later](http://jdk.java.net/9/)
 - [maven 2.x](https://maven.apache.org/) or [ant](http://ant.apache.org/)


## Target Platform

All external dependencies are expected in `dependencies/target/lib`.
They could be obtained by expanding a zip-ed folder from an existing build setup, or via one initial maven run:


```
mvn clean verify  -f dependencies/pom.xml
```


## Building with maven

### Quickstart (Build & run)

To build and run the phoebus product

```
mvn install exec:java
```
 
### Building

```
mvn clean install
```

### Running test application
```
cd phoebus-product/target
java -jar product-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```



## Building with ant

```
ant clean run
```


## Developing with Eclipse

Download Eclipse Oxygen 4.7.1a from http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/

Start Eclipse like this:

	export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk-9
	export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
	eclipse/eclipse -consoleLog

Check Eclipse Preferences:

 * Java, Installed JREs: JDK 9 should be the default
 * Java, Compiler: JDK Compliance should be "9"


### Use plain Java configuration

Use `File`, `Import`, `General`, `Existing Projects into Workspace`.
Select the phoebus root directory, and check the option to "Seach for nested projects".

By default, all projects should be selected ('dependencies', 'core-framework', .., 'product').

Invoke `Run As/Java Application` on the `Launcher` in the product.


### Use Maven Files in Eclipse

In Help/Eclipse Marketplace, search for Maven Integration for Eclipse Luna or newer

Use File/Import/Maven/Existing Maven Projects to import the phoebus source code.

There can be a compiler error because the "JRE System Library" in the Package Explorer shows "[J2SE-1.4]".
Right click on the affected projects (greeting-app, probe), Build Path, Configure Build Path, Libraries, Edit the JRE System Library to use the Workspace default (jdk-9).
Restart Eclipse IDE.

Can now start product/src/main/java/org.phoebus.product/Launcher.java.


## Developing with Intellij IDEA

First, download the target platform as described above.

To import the project:

* Start Intellij
* Import Project
* Select the Phoebus directory
* Import project from external model: Maven
* Accept the default options and click Next twice
* Ensure that the JDK is version 9 or above
* Change the project name to Phoebus and click finish

To run the Phoebus application:

* Run | Edit Configurations...
* Select + | Application
* Search for main class and type Launcher
* Use classpath of module: select product
* Set the name to Phoebus
* Click OK
* In the top right of the IDE, click the green play button


## Developing with NetBeans

First download [NetBeans 9](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/nb90/nb90.html),
then the target platform as described above. After running NetBeans, select
**Tools** ➜ **Java Platforms** and make sure that a Java 9 or 10 platform is set as
the default one.

To open the Maven project Select the **File** ➜ **Open Project…** and select the
*phoebus* root project folder.

On the **Projects** view right-click on the *phoebus (parent)* node and select the
**Clean and Build** menu item. To build without the unit test, right-click the
*phoebus (parent)* node and select **Run Maven** ➜ **Skip Tests**.

To run the Phoebus application:

 * Open the *phoebus (parent)* project and the *Modules* node, then double-click on
   the  *product* module;
 * Now right-click on the opened *product* project and select *Run*;
 * A dialog will open to select the main class to be run. Verify that
   `org.phoebus.product.Launcher` is selected and press the *Select Main Class*
   button to start the application.
 * You can also select *Remember Permanently* to allow NetBeans remembering the
   chosen class.
 * Right-clicking the *product* project it is also possible to select
   *Set as Main Project*. In this way the Phoebus application can be started just
   pressing the *F6* key, the *Run Main Project* toolbar button, or the
   *Run* ➜ *Run Main Project* menu item.
